# In General {#general}

Many resources are available to help you be a successful student:

- If you are food insecure, [you are not alone](https://www.wjbf.com/csra-news/nearly-36-percent-of-college-students-are-hungry/), and the [Open Paws Food Pantry](https://www.augusta.edu/student-affairs/open-paws.php) will help you.
- For tutoring resources, consult the [Academic Success Center](https://www.augusta.edu/academicsuccess/) (or "ASC"). It can help you, among other things, in the areas of time management, test preparation and study strategies.
- [Student Counseling & Psychological Services](https://www.augusta.edu/counseling/) (or "SCAPS") is here to assist students with a variety of personal, developmental, and mental health concerns.
- The [Writing Center](https://www.augusta.edu/pamplin/writingcenter/) can help you with any written, oral, or multimedia project.
- To get help with technologies, refer to our [Instructional Technology Support](https://www.augusta.edu/continuity/index.php) correspondent [Sienna Sewell](https://spots.augusta.edu/sSewell/).

# For Students of the School of Computer and Cyber Sciences {#school}

## School of Computer and Cyber Sciences Tutoring Center

The School has a tutoring center that can be reached:

- On [discord](https://discord.gg/kzKtrjzCyH),
- During their tutoring hours (hours posted on the door and on discord), in University Hall 129.

## ACM Club

The [Augusta University chapter](https://spots.augusta.edu/cyberdefense) of the [A.C.M](https://www.acm.org/ "Association for Computing Machinery") is one of the university's best resources for Computer Science, Information Technology and Cyber Security students.
It provides a platform to network with other students in similar majors, presenting countless opportunities to not only expand the people you know, but also a fantastic place to learn and ask questions.
To learn more, you can sign up for the newsletter, or attend one of the subgroup meetings (meeting times and locations are listed [on the website](https://spots.augusta.edu/cyberdefense)).

## Other Club Activities

The Augusta University Game Design Club and Girls Who Code College Loop "will be continuing activities in full force this year".  Notifications for upcoming activities will be shared in class alongside school-wide emails.
